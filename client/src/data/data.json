I am very excited about the journey ahead.My choice of song is Mr Blue Sky by The Electric Light Orchestra. It is one of my absolute favourite songs and is nothing but positive vibes.\nFor my quote, I have chosen one which I think is is quite applicable to coding:‚ÄúI have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work.‚Äù\n‚Äï Thomas A. EdisonI hope everyone has a great day!"

Don't ever be afraid to reach out for help and support if you need it. Looking forward to the next 4 months and beyond.\nMy choice of song comes from a trio I have seen many times. Their sets always fill the room with such happiness and euphoria! Zo√´ Johnston features with stunning vocals on a song by Above and Beyond called ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre All We Need‚Äù.\nMy inspirational quote comes from an incredible actor; the late, great and talented Robin Williams who dedicated his life to putting smile on other peoples face.\n‚ÄúThere is still a lot to learn and there is always great stuff out there. Even mistakes can be wonderful‚Äù\n ‚Äï Robin Williams\n@Ellie Priestley ü´µ You're up next!\nHave an awesome day! üëã"

Hope everyone is feeling positive and ready for an amazing weekend! ‚ò∫Ô∏èWith that theme in mind, my quote for ‚ú®Daily Joy Challenge‚ú® today is:\n\"The rest is just as important as the work\"\nI've had to remind myself of this constantly this week - it's so easy to get hooked on the challenges and before you know it hours have passed! Remember we're only a week into our four months, and that it's a marathon rather than a sprint. Let's make sure to all take some time this weekend to recharge and reset so we can all be energised for next week ü•≥Following on from the Friday theme, my song of the day pick is \"September\" by Earth, Wind & Fire: an absolute classic Friday bop üï∫\nMy nomination for Monday is @Kumani! Have a restful weekend all and see you soon üí´"
