The human brain cannot comprehend the Negative it is incapable, let me give you an example don't think of a pink elephant! I bet you thought of an elephant... Just like a skier who skies thinking don't hit the trees.. He inevitably hits the trees, thats the course he took his mind to. Where as the skier who looks for the path ends up sliding in out between the trees following an unclear path, but a path he has set his mind on. Just like the skier we all will come across obstacles we must not allow ourselves to focus on these obstacles! We shall set our minds on the end goal the path and that is what we will achieve ‚ú® Have a lovely day!"
